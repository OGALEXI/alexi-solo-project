                    <h3>Anxiety:</h3>
                    <p>Slow breathing. 
                        When you’re anxious, your breathing becomes 
                        faster and shallower. Try deliberately slowing 
                        down your breathing. Count to three as you breathe 
                        in slowly – then count to three as you breathe out slowly.</p>

                    <h3>Depression:</h3>
                    <p>Express yourself in writing. Writing in a journal is great 
                        therapy and can help you manage depression. You can relieve 
                        stress by being open about your thoughts, feelings, and 
                        concerns in your writing — and stress management is an 
                        important part of living well with depression. Be totally
                         honest in your private journal. Writing down your feelings 
                         and challenges with depression can release pent-up emotions. 
                         You'll be amazed at how much better you feel after putting pen 
                         to paper for just a few minutes each day.
                         Reach out and stay connected. Getting support plays an essential
                         role in overcoming depression. On your own, it can be difficult to
                          maintain a healthy perspective and sustain the effort required to 
                          beat depression. At the same time, the very nature of depression 
                          makes it difficult to reach out for help. When you’re depressed, 
                          the tendency is to withdraw and isolate so that connecting to 
                          even close family members and friends can be tough.</p>

                    <h3>OCD:</h3>
                    <p>Refocus your attention. If you are experiencing OCD compulsions 
                        or obsessions, or you feel one coming on try to refocus your
                         attention from the situation. Refocusing your attention can
                          be done physically or mentally. If at the end of the refocusing
                           period you still feel the need to complete your obsession try 
                           repeating the session again.</p>

                    <h3>Trauma:</h3>
                    <p>Develop a toolbox of deep breathing, relaxation skills, and meditation 
                        skills. A favorite of ours is circular breathing. This is where you 
                        take a slow breath in and as you are doing this count to five in your
                         mind. At the top of your breath, hold it for 5 seconds as you count 
                         to five in your mind. Then slowly let your breath out, again counting
                          to five as you do this. Lastly, at the bottom of your breath, 
                          before you breathe in again, hold it for the same 5 seconds. 
                          This is where you start all over again. Try this for a couple of cycles.</p>

                    <p>Mindfulness. Using mindfulness for anxiety can be very helpful. 
                        Mindfulness has been around for ages. However, mental health 
                        professionals are beginning to recognize that mindfulness can 
                        have many benefits for people dealing with anxiety and depression.</p>

                    <h3>Anger:</h3>
                    <p>Identify possible solutions. Instead of focusing on what made you
                         mad, work on resolving the issue at hand. Does your child's messy 
                         room drive you crazy? Close the door. Is your partner late for 
                         dinner every night? Schedule meals later in the evening — or agree 
                         to eat on your own a few times a week. Remind yourself that anger 
                         won't fix anything and might only make it worse.</p>

                <h2>What are coping mechanisms?</h2>
                <div className="inner-cope">
                    <p className="what-are">Coping mechanisms are the strategies 
                        people often use in the face of stress 
                        and/or trauma to help manage painful or 
                        difficult emotions. Coping mechanisms 
                        can help people adjust to stressful events
                         while helping them maintain their emotional 
                         well-being.</p>
                         <p className="what-are">
                             Significant life events, whether 
                         positive or negative, can cause psychological stress. 
                         Difficult events, such as divorce, miscarriage, 
                         the death of a loved one, or the loss of a job, 
                         can cause most people to feel grief or distress. 
                         But even events that are considered positive by 
                         many—getting married, having a child, and buying 
                         a home—can lead to a significant amounts of stress. 
                         To adjust to this stress, people may utilize some 
                         combination of behavior, thought, and emotion, 
                         depending on the situation. People may use coping 
                         mechanisms for stress management or to cope with anger,
                         loneliness, anxiety, or depression.
